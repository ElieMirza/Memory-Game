# Memory Game!
Simon is a game of memory skill that creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user succeeds, the game will level up and the series become progressively longer and more complex. 
Once the user fails, the background turns red and game is over.

Run Instructions: You can access the game on this link
